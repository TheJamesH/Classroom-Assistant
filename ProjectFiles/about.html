        <h1>Covala</h1>
        <p>Classroom-Oriented Voice-Activated Learning Assistant</p>
        <p></p>
          
        <h2>Our Idea</h2>
        <p>Corvala is a classroom-oriented voice-activated learning assistant that consists of an Amazon Echo Dot device and the Corvala web application. Using the Echo Dot device, voice commands can be issued that ask Alexa, the Echo Dot OS, to automate tedious classroom tasks. These tasks include taking student attendance and setting time voice alerts for tests. The Corvala website can be used to link to an external learning management system, or can help teachers create a student database from scratch.</p>
        <p></p>

        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>Google and Amazon have been developing voice controlled smart speakers for home use. These smart speakers act as artificial personal assistants and can respond to a variety of commands. The Corvala project focuses on adapting this technology from a home setting to a classroom setting. Corvala aims to give teachers the tools to automate repetitive tasks, and provide a hands free way of managing classroom records. </p>
        <p></p>  
          
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>The Corvala project specifically deals in creating software that will accomplish two tasks. The first task is creating new actions for the Echo Dot that can be used in a classroom. The second task is to connect the Corvala  to Learning Management Systems to provide easy control over classroom records.</p>
